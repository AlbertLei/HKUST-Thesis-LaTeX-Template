# HKUST Thesis LaTeX Template

This thesis template might be used for the Economics PhD Thesis at HKUST. The `.zip` file contains all the files to run locally. It is adpated from the [Template provided by Math Department](https://www.math.ust.hk/intranet/pg.php) with the following modifications:
  - chapter-wise citation and bibliography using `natbib`,
  - add each References as a separate section, and
  - other small changes (say a compact table of contents, some command like `thesisWriter{}`, and others).
  
The template is also [available on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hbbwnvpyjskf). I find it thorny to run the code locally as it requires multiple compilings.

A suggested workflow is to have three LaTeXed essays, then import them to each chapter in the Template, and finally run them online.
